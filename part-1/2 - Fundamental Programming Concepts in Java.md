## 2.6 Conditional and Looping constructs

Normally, statements in a program are executed one after the other in the order in which theyâ€™re written. This process is 
called sequential execution. There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times or you may
 want to execute a block just if a particular condition is met. There are java statements that make it possible to alter the normal
 sequential execution. In this section, we'll look at two of them, the `if`, `if else` and `while` statements. We'll see the remaining looping statements as we progress through the course.
 
### 2.6.1 The if statement
 
 There are two things you need to know about if statements; they make use of comparison operators and the boolean datatype.
 Comparison operators include > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to), == (equal to), != (not equal to).
 
 A boolean type in java is a logical type. It can only take two values, a true or a false. Unlike other languages like C, where boolean types are syntactic sugars for 0s and 1s, in java a boolean cannot take a 0 or a 1. It can only take a true or a false. Comparison operations in java return booleans. 
 
 **Example**
 
 ```java
 public class BooleanTypes {
 
     public static void main(String[] args) {
     
         boolean a = true;
         System.out.println(a);
         
         boolean result = 23 < 1;
         System.out.println(result);
     }
 }
 ```
 
 **Output**
 
 ```
 true
 false
 ```
 
 The `if` statement executes some code when a condition is true and skips that line of code if the condition is false.
 
 **Examples**
 
 We'll calculate the largest of two numbers
 
 ```java
 public class Largest {
 
     public static void main(String[] args) {
     
         int a = 23;
         int b = 19;
         
         if (a > b) {
             System.out.println("a is greater than b");
         }
     }
 }
 ```
 
 **Output**
 
`a is greater than b`

Lines 21 and 22 initializes two variables a and b to 23 and 19 respectively. On line 24, we have an if statement that checks if
a is greater than b. If true, which in that case it is, the code inside the curly braces is executed.
If we change the values of a and b such that the condition is false, the code in line 25 will not be executed.

### 2.6.1 if else statement

The if...else statement performs an action if a condition is true and performs a different action if the condition is false.

**Example**

```java
public class Largest2 {
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
        int a = 23;
        int b = 19;
        
        if (a > b) {
            System.out.println("a is greater than b");
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("a is not greater than b");
        }
    }
}
```

**Output**

`a is not greater than b`

### 2.6.3 else if statement

You can do multiple comparisons with java else if construct.

**Example**

```java
public class MultipleSelections {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
        int a = 23;
        int b = 119;
        
        if (a > b) {
            System.out.println("a is greater than b");
        }
        else if (a < b) {
            System.out.println("a is less than b");
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("a equals b");
        }
    }
}
```

**Output**

`a is less than b`

### 2.6.4 While statement

The while statement is one of the 3 java looping statements which include, **while**, **do while** and **for**. In this section will look at only the while statement. The java while statement is used to repeat execution of some block of code multiple times if a particular condition is true.

The example below prints integers from 1-10 and their squares.

```java
public class WhileLoop {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
       int n = 0;
       while (n < 10) {
           System.out.println(n);
           n++;
       }
    }
}
```

**Output**
```
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
```

### 2.6.5 For loops
The next looping construct we'll see is the for loop. The for loop is similar to the while loop except that, the counter initialization, condition and increment are done on one line. The example below does the same thing that was done by the while loop.

```java
public class ForLoop {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
        for (int i = 0;i < 10;i++) {
            System.out.println(n);
        }
    }
}
```

## 2.7 Arrays
Arrays holds group of elements of the same type. It is the most basic data structure in java. The example below creates an array to hold 10 integers, initialize the values from 0-9 and display the values the array.

```java
public class WorkingArrays {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
        int[] numbers = new int[10];
        for (int i = 0;i < numbers.length;i++) {
            numbers[i] = i;
            System.out.println(numbers[i]);
        }
    }
}
```
